[2025-05-06 23:39:38] Error loading data: time data "25/8/2023" doesn't match format "%m/%d/%Y", at position 1. You might want to try:
    - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;
    - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;
    - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.
